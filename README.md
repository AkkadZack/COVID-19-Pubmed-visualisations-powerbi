# COVID 19 Pubmed visualisations powerbi
First, you must download the data from pubmed
go to pubmed , search for covid-19 , download the csv version , the text/pubmed version and the abstract version
then you have to parse those files by the python scripts provided and made in this project to be able to mount the data to powerBI
Then,we treat the files generated by our scripts individually to load them up in powerBI by using the right separators
after, we put the data to use in order to make visualisations such as number of authors, TOP 10 first authors who wrote about covid 19, keywords etc etc
