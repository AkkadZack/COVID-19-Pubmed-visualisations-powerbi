The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as         2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related         to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus         (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology.         Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East         Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better         sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid         sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of         1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have         been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already         confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV.         Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting         enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein         of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein         antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide         cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play         an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host         defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.  
PMID- 32389849-AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China.         They have certain biological, epidemiological and pathological similarities. To         date, research has shown that their genes exhibit 79% of identical sequences and the         receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar. There has been extensive         research performed on SARS; however, the understanding of the pathophysiological         impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still limited. METHODS: This review         drew upon the lessons learnt from SARS, in terms of epidemiology, clinical         characteristics and pathogenesis, to further understand the features of COVID-19.         RESULTS: By comparing these two diseases, it found that COVID-19 has quicker and         wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, and higher morbidity and         mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases emerged in         COVID-19 literature. Children starting with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress         to severe conditions and newborns whose mothers are infected with COVID-19 could         have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed that the percentage of         neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, and the number of CD4+ and CD8+T-cells         is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Based on these early         observations, as pediatricians, this review put forward some thoughts on children's         COVID-19 and gave some recommendations to contain the disease.

PMID- 32774178-AB  - In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome         Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or (2019-nCoV) with unknown origin spread in Hubei         province of China. The epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 called coronavirus         disease-19 (COVID-19). The presence of COVID-19 was manifested by several symptoms,         ranging from asymptomatic/mild symptoms to severe illness and death. The viral         infection expanded internationally and WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of         International Concern. To quickly diagnose and control such a highly infectious         disease, suspicious individuals were isolated and diagnostic/treatment procedures         were developed through patients' epidemiological and clinical data. Early in the         COVID-19 outbreak, WHO invited hundreds of researchers from around the world to         develop a rapid quality diagnosis, treatment and vaccines, but so far no specific         antiviral treatment or vaccine has been approved by the FDA. At present, COVID-19 is         managed by available antiviral drugs to improve the symptoms, and in severe cases,         supportive care including oxygen and mechanical ventilation is used for infected         patients. However, due to the worldwide spread of the virus, COVID-19 has become a         serious concern in the medical community. According to the current data of WHO, the         number of infected and dead cases has increased to 8,708,008 and 461,715,         respectively (Dec 2019 -June 2020). Given the high mortality rate and economic         damage to various communities to date, great efforts must be made to produce         successful drugs and vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection. For this reason, first of         all, the characteristics of the virus, its pathogenicity, and its infectious         pathways must be well known. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to provide an         overview of this epidemic disease based on the current evidence.  CI  - © The Author(s) 2020.  
PMID- 32348588-AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from         the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has         spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. The         disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like         symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here, we provide an         overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19. We         carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed,         Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following         keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. We included         publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features         and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and         through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is         fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is         recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,         cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and         gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal         swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography         findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no         evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to         treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and         respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed,         quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the         contagion rate. Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to         determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.

PMID- 32744561-AB  - A new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, in December         2019. The SARS-CoV-2 spread very rapidly, causing a global pandemic, Coronavirus         Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Older adults have higher peak of viral load and, especially         those with comorbidities, had higher COVID-19-related fatality rates than younger         adults. In this Perspective paper, we summarize current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2         and aging, in order to understand why older people are more affected by COVID-19. We         discuss about the possibility that the so-called "immunosenescence" and         "inflammaging" processes, already present in a fraction of frail older adults, could         allow the immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 serious complications.         Finally, we propose to use geroscience approaches to the field of COVID-19.  
PMID- 32134278-AB  - Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens         including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome         coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and         more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition         associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).         The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly         pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing         emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human         health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus,         still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus         infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or         post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and         epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the         research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick         understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective         therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal         antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to         fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies         has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the         potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by         considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against         similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19         pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific         anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.  
PMID- 32096567-AB  - Since December 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases have been reported in         Wuhan, China. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily         named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On 11 February 2020,         the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019-nCoV as coronavirus disease         (COVID-19). The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading all over the world, especially in         China. Based on the published evidence, we systematically discuss the         characteristics of COVID-19 in the hope of providing a reference for future studies         and help for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

PMID- 32147496-AB  - Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a         broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel         emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific community should consider this         information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of         antiviral research.  CI  - Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

PMID- 32340833-AB  - In early December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused         by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in         Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization         declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As of         February 14, 2020, 49,053 laboratory-confirmed and 1,381 deaths have been reported         globally. Perceived risk of acquiring disease has led many governments to institute         a variety of control measures. We conducted a literature review of publicly         available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current         epidemic. In this literature review, the causative agent, pathogenesis and immune         responses, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and management of the disease, control         and preventions strategies are all reviewed.

PMID- 32234466-AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province,         Central China, and has spread quickly to 72 countries to date. COVID-19 is caused by         a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2         (SARS-CoV-2) [previously provisionally known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)].         At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with         tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public         health. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic         drugs available for COVID-19. Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is         urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological         characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the         development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, this review         will focus on recent progress regarding the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the         characteristics of COVID-19, such as the aetiology, pathogenesis and epidemiological         characteristics.

PMID- 32188753-AB  - The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)         from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the epidemic potential of         coronaviruses. The rapid spread of this virus across the world in only 2 months         highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses and the significant         morbidity and mortality that they can cause. We highlight the current state of         knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions concerning the current         outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

PMID- 32609256-AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease initially reported in         China and currently worldwide dispersed caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or         2019-nCoV) affecting more than seven million people around the world causing more         than 400 thousand deaths (on June 8th, 2020). The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on         the clinical and epidemiological history of the patient. However, the gold standard         for COVID-19 diagnosis is the viral detection through the amplification of nucleic         acids. Although the quantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction         (RT-PCR) has been described as the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19, there are         several difficulties involving its use. Here we comment on RT-PCR and describe         alternative tests developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19.  
PMID- 32283152-AB  - Cytokine storm is an excessive immune response to external stimuli. The pathogenesis         of the cytokine storm is complex. The disease progresses rapidly, and the mortality         is high. Certain evidence shows that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)         epidemic, the severe deterioration of some patients has been closely related to the         cytokine storm in their bodies. This article reviews the occurrence mechanism and         treatment strategies of the COVID-19 virus-induced inflammatory storm in attempt to         provide valuable medication guidance for clinical treatment.

PMID- 32238757-AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness such         as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei,         China. The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus,         now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is         most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in         2002. Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China         and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human         casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the         ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread         are urgently needed. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are         available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be         clinically effective. In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to         develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Here, we review the current status         of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.  
PMID- 32104915-AB  - Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle         East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic         coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December         2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly         homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia         coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported         for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19         is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care         could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also         showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence         shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that         they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The         infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and         experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some         coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to         the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors         in the lung and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between         SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of         SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients         with COVID-19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention         and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.  CI  - © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  
PMID- 32617354-AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the infection caused by 2019 novel coronavirus         (COVID-19) led to an outbreak in Wuhan, situated in the Hubei Province of China.         Following this, there has been a rapid increase in the number of cases. On 12th         March 2020, there were over 100,000 confirmed cases and almost 4,300 deaths         worldwide. The clinical profile of children with COVID-19 is unknown due to the few         number of cases reported. Currently, available data suggest they may have a milder         form of illness. METHODS: A review of the literature published from June 2019 to         March 2020 was undertaken to evaluate the clinical presentation, management and         outcomes of COVID-19 in in children. Data sources included EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane         library, ISI Web of Knowledge and references within identified articles. RESULTS: We         identified 303 potential studies, and 295 were excluded for reasons including         duplicates, experimental studies and case reports. Eight studies were eligible for         inclusion, including a total of 820 paediatric cases of COVID-19. Asymptomatic cases         represented 14.3% (n = 117) of the total number of cases identified, and thus the         remaining 85.7% (n = 703) experienced symptoms. Fever was the commonest symptom in         53.9% (n = 48) of cases, followed by cough in 39.3% (n = 35) of cases, and         rhinorrhoea or pharyngeal congestion in 13.5% (n = 12) of cases. Diarrhoea and sore         throats were less common symptoms, 7.9% (n = 7) and 9.0% (n = 8) respectively. Other         symptoms, including fatigue, headache and dizziness were rare. CONCLUSION: Children         are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and are more likely to run a milder         cause of illness following this infection compared to adults. This outbreak only         started 3 months ago, therefore, further population wide studies are needed to         validate these findings.  CI  - © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.
